Apart from a small bag, he carries nothing, showing no concern for the potential dangers ahead. In fact, he is about to encounter the first of these potential dangers, as one more step will send him tumbling over the cliff he is approaching. Yet this seems to elude him — we're unsure if he's naive or simply unaware.

When we encounter him, he approaches each day with the excitement of an adventure, in an almost childish manner. He believes anything is possible in life, with plenty of opportunities waiting to be explored and developed in the world. He lives a simple life, carefree, seemingly unconcerned about what the future might hold due to his inability to predict it.",

Take the time to understand how your current behavior affects your colleagues before taking action.

This is a more complex phrase, summarizing that the earth reflects heaven, the outside reflects the inside, the microcosm reflects the macrocosm, and the earth reflects God. This can also be interpreted as the Magician symbolizing the ability to act as an intermediary between the upper world and the contemporary human world. On his table, the Magician also wields all the tarot cards. This symbolizes the Magician's connection of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.

This could be in your new job, new venture, new romance, or other areas. It indicates that now is the time for action, and any signs of hesitation mean missing the opportunity to be your best self.

Getting this card may mean someone is pretending to have your best interests at heart when, in fact, quite the opposite is true.

You need to carefully examine what the real risks are and understand if your fears are genuinely grounded in reality or if they stem from different sources.

The High Priestess sits between the two, indicating her role as a mediator in the depths of reality. She is the third pillar—the path between the two. She sees these two pillars as equal, with knowledge to be gained in both worlds. You'll also notice she wears the crown of Isis, which may signify her allegiance to magic.

She represents an intuitive person who begins to open up to her or his spirituality. Meditation, prayer, and new spiritual work are indicated. The card itself shows a nocturnal scene, indicating the world she protects and guards may seem frightening at first glance but may guide us into personal growth.

The Empress is also a strong sign of pregnancy and motherhood. You may look to other cards to confirm whether this is a literal pregnancy or, more accurately, an attitude of motherhood, nurturing, and care. The Empress card can also signify the birth of new ideas, businesses, or projects in your life. With the good fortune surrounding this card, you can be confident that such situations and endeavors will end successfully in your life. Identify and pursue those ideas that have been persistent in your mind and ensure you dedicate yourself to bringing them to fruition.

In a shift of roles, perhaps a reversed Empress is entering your life; this could also represent you relying on others to take care of you and make decisions for you.

The Emperor's long beard represents his rich experience; over time, he has learned much about ruling, establishing power, authority, and maintaining order for the benefit of his people.

  The Emperor card represents moral laws and regulations, leaning towards order, norms, and stable situations, possessing supreme authority. However, precisely because of these rationality and authority, personal emotions must be suppressed, and there is a metaphor of 'loneliness at the top'.",
        "upright_content" => "For the Emperor, everything revolves around control, as this card signifies authority, supervision, organization, and fatherly love. The Emperor represents a strategic thinker who devises plans he must see through. He is a symbol of the masculine principle in life, embodying structure, rule-making, and systematization, while imparting knowledge. While the Empress desires to create happiness in her kingdom, the Emperor desires to cultivate honor and discipline. He guides with a firm hand, following the call of the crown above all else. Though he is a ruler, he understands that rulership is also service, thus his actions are rational and for the greater good of the kingdom.

  Seeing him in the tarot offers an opportunity for growth in setting goals for yourself. As long as you pursue goals with the same methodical, strategic approach as the Emperor, a successful future will manifest.

  When you see him in the tarot, a possible interpretation is that you may take charge of something significant. It could be a position in work or any organization or institution in urgent need of order and decisive thinking. You may be called upon to take action in place of the Emperor, using his wisdom to clarify projects.",

It may also be you playing the role of a weak ruler, devising a plan to avoid the tasks of responsibility. Perhaps you long for a more flexible profession than one constrained by strict rules.

  On a personal level, the Emperor can represent a lack of self-discipline and an inability to handle situations. When he is reversed, the structures, rules, and systems he creates no longer work. His desire to spark higher desires for principles in his kingdom has turned into heartlessness, tyranny, and rigidity. He seeks to rule, forgetting the call of the throne to do the best for his people, only concerned with losing control and causing suffering.",

Be cautious not to relinquish too much personal power or suppress yourself to become a reality in this relationship. Alternatively, this card may also indicate difficulty in emotional connection in your relationship or potential relationship.",

Sometimes, this card may also suggest stagnation and bureaucracy in your work environment. This could stifle your creativity and motivation as processes required for anything become dull and frustrating. In the worst case, the reversed Emperor can point to senior employees or bosses ruling the workplace like tyrants. If this is your situation, it's best to start looking for work elsewhere.",

If the latter applies, you really need to take a close look at your income and expenses and learn to cut back.",

On the other hand, he carries a triple cross traditionally associated with the Hierophant. Each horizontal bar on the cross is believed to represent the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Below him, sit two acolytes representing the transfer of sacred knowledge within the institution. Through these followers, this card also represents the path of seeking knowledge and education.

The appearance of the Hierophant card indicates that you have the opportunity to integrate the mind and spirit, elevating your awareness to higher levels. In other words, you can cultivate your talents through continuous learning and heeding good advice.

  The Hierophant card suggests that you would do well to follow established and traditional social structures of your own. For example, you may engage in certain rituals, ceremonies, or other religious rites. In terms of tarot cards, this special card most commonly represents institutions and their core values. It is a sign that you need to adhere to existing rules and situations.",

As a result, you've lost a lot of control and flexibility in life. You have a strong will and desire to move forward, regain control, and break free from traditional constraints.

The sacred love in tarot can also represent more spiritual aspects of love, reminding us to treat our partners with morality and compassion. Sometimes, this card can also symbolize marriage.

When it comes to shared values and creating a future together, the reversed Hierophant may suggest that your views may not quite align with your own. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it may require some compromise.

  Generally, this card also indicates that not all advice you receive about your romantic relationship at this time may be helpful to you. It's best to think for yourself what works best for your love life rather than relying on others to tell you what's right for you.",

The angel depicted here is the Air angel Raphael - who shares the same element as the constellation ruling this card: Gemini.

Another meaning behind the Lovers is the concept of choice - choosing between opposites and exclusives. It could be a dilemma where you need to carefully consider and make the best decision for your situation. The more personalized meaning applicable to individuals involves developing your own belief system, regardless of societal norms. We see it as the development of a sacred doctrine, where one formulates laws and passes on their knowledge through standardized systems. It's a time when you're figuring out what you stand for and what your life philosophy will be. You must start deciding what you deem important and what isn't.

At this time, you should also consider your personal values and belief systems to ensure they align with the life you want. Communication breakdown could be another possible interpretation. The foundation of your interpersonal relationships may be severed, causing imbalance between you and your partner or loved ones. The unity often present in the card has become imbalanced. The reversed Lovers can also suggest that you've been avoiding taking responsibility for your actions. You could have made decisions based on your desires at the moment, but now you're attributing the consequences catching up to you to others. So, you need to make amends or let go of the past and make better decisions for the future.",

The tarot card symbolizes wonderful cohesion and strength balance, indicating complementary energies. It represents a pair that can work well together. On the other hand, because the card also symbolizes choices and commitment, it raises questions about your level of commitment to love. This doesn't have to specifically point to another person, but can also indicate choosing between love and work, love and family, love and friendships, or sometimes love and your entire lifestyle. The idea here is that to have this kind of love, you might have to make sacrifices. In some ways, all commitments are a form of sacrifice, but commitments made for the right person can help you grow as an individual.",

A square on his chest represents the elements of earth and the material world, the foundation of him and his actions.
    The sphinxes are painted black and white, symbolizing the opposing forces the charioteer must learn to control. Here, they are calm, but often at odds due to their apparent desire to move in different directions, leading to a struggle. His task is to guide these sphinxes toward a destination, one marked by the universal forces he represents. The Chariot is associated with the Cancer zodiac sign.",

    He brings you the key message that you must remain focused, confident, and determined amid twists and turns. If you have a seemingly uncertain plan or project, the Chariot suggests that you execute it in a structured and orderly manner. Your boldness will ensure you achieve everything expected of you in this endeavor.
    In the pursuit of goals with the Chariot, he may exhibit behaviors he has never seen in himself before—competition and a desire for success may make his character more aggressive. Aggression is a natural part of human nature, and the Chariot reminds you that it can also be used to help you control your situation, but it must also be controlled to avoid hindering your path forward.",

Seeing the reversed Chariot may indicate that you need to accept the fact that you cannot always be in control.
    The reversed meaning of the Chariot may also suggest a lack of control and direction in life. You are at the mercy of opposing forces and obstacles, seemingly unable to muster the strength to take charge. You are letting go of everything, and life is moving in any direction it pleases.

    As you move towards your goals, the Chariot tarot card in love may also indicate the need to balance two impulses, represented by the two horses in the card. They may pull you in different directions, but a clear path ahead means controlling everyone to keep you on the right track. This card sometimes brings up questions about whether your choices so far have been balanced; is your relationship affected by too much work time?

Showing up every day with hope and enthusiasm is important, but patience is also important. Let love find you.
    The reversed Chariot in love may also indicate that things may be out of balance, and you may need to make efforts again to correct them.

  You are currently contemplating the need for solitude. Never be afraid to seize this opportunity for reflection, as it can help clear away all the clutter of daily life. The Hermit may also indicate your efforts to take authentic action and stay true to your true self. You may be seeking inner guidance to find the right direction and goals for the next step.

  The appearance of the Hermit in the tarot cards may also indicate the arrival of someone in your life who will become your mentor.",
        "reversed_content" => "When reversed, you may find yourself in a situation where you want to be alone, and that's okay. However, your seclusion may be detrimental to both yourself and others. While the Hermit sets out with lofty aspirations to seek the truth within, the path to his inner self may also be fraught with great danger. Going inward can lead to madness and abyss, as the unconscious is filled with images he may not yet understand, lurking to tempt him in. Like one lost in their own dreams, the Hermit may find himself trapped in his own world, lonely, trapped, unreal. You must learn to balance your need for truth with connections to your fellow human beings.

  In terms of work, the reversed Hermit suggests that you are ready to delve deeper into something that has been troubling you for a long time. Searches need to be conducted, and you have a responsibility to ask questions and make others aware of the situation.",
        "upright_love" => "Love, as one of life's greatest mysteries, can be a great teacher. It requires all of us to truly understand ourselves, our needs, our fears, and our insecurities. The love meaning of the Hermit tarot card suggests that before establishing a solid romantic relationship with another person, we may need some time alone to gain some understanding of ourselves. This period may feel a bit lonely, but it will set you on the right path to find the love you desire. If you are already in a romantic relationship, this introspection is something both of you might want to do together. You both may want to consider what you expect from a relationship and what will make you happier. The initial conversations may be uncomfortable, but they will lay a solid foundation for addressing future issues.",

While this time may be challenging, making the most of it can help you focus on your goals and clarify what you want from a partner and life. These will be the cornerstones of building a strong future relationship. If you are already in a romantic relationship, you may find that one of you feels distant and is gradually withdrawing. Despite efforts from both parties, someone may feel lonely in the partnership. Now is the time to examine these dynamics and see if there are ways you can reach out. It may require attention, care, and a strong sense of self-awareness to feel connected again.",

You may feel that the path you are currently on is not truly fulfilling for you, and there may be a sense of dissatisfaction. Now, you are trying to understand what kind of work would bring you happiness on various levels. If you are purely in it for money or financial stability, then those qualifications may no longer be enough for you. You may be seeking a purpose, or at least something that brings you closer to the person you want to become.",
        "reversed_career" => "Sometimes, the reversed Hermit can signal the end of a period of contemplation. You may be ready to reintegrate into society, this time with a clearer understanding of what you want from your career. Adjustments may now be needed, whether it's searching for a new job, networking to find mentors and allies, or developing other social aspects of your career. On the other hand, it could also mean that your period of solitude could be further extended; you may choose to avoid collaboration with others altogether. Initially, the feeling of being alone may be much less; but make sure you continue to receive social support. Sometimes, this card may also indicate being forced to work alone, leading to feelings of loneliness, or being abandoned by colleagues.",

In the center of the card, there is a large wheel covered with intricate symbols. Surrounding the wheel are various creatures: an angel, an eagle, a bull, and a lion. These are associated with the four fixed signs of the Zodiac – Leo, Taurus, Scorpio, and Aquarius. These four animals also represent the four Gospel writers in Christian tradition, perhaps explaining their adorned wings.

    Each creature holds a book, representing the Torah that communicates wisdom and self-understanding. The serpent signifies the descent into the material world. Riding atop the wheel itself is a sphinx-like figure seated at the top, while what appears to be a devil, or perhaps Anubis himself, appears at the bottom. These two Egyptian figures represent the wisdom of the gods and kings (in the case of the sphinx) and the underworld (Anubis). They forever revolve in a cycle, indicating that as one rises, another falls.",

It's something that both kings and laborers are subject to, and no one on Earth can avoid what is destined to happen. When you encounter moments of joy in life, make sure to savor them fully, as what goes up must come down. Similarly, when you find yourself in dire straits, things will eventually turn for the better.

    There's a powerful force at play here that humans cannot control. The same force that governs the changing of the seasons or the rising and setting of the sun also governs luck and individual destiny. Its landing is as random as chance – you might find yourself at the top or the bottom, but remember, whatever the outcome, it may not last long, as the wheel is always turning.",

When associated with this card, you must understand that these are due to external influences beyond your control. Like the wheel, our luck and destiny are always in motion, and sometimes we find ourselves at the bottom. Rest assured, the wheel will turn again, and you'll soon be back on top.

    However, what you shouldn't do is cling to the illusion of control. Perhaps the lesson in this cycle is to learn to let go and surrender. Some things cannot be propelled by human will and action alone. When we fail to let go, it only brings more suffering, as you may blame yourself for actions that couldn't change the circumstances. When we learn to accept, we also learn to forgive ourselves. We learn to move forward and continue – ultimately, understanding that this acceptance can once again propel the wheel forward and into a new cycle.",

If you choose to make the effort, your partnership might become closer than ever, as both of you learn to navigate life's ups and downs as a team.

Depending on your circumstances, your interpretation of this card may vary.

        If you've been wronged, the appearance of this card might bring you relief. On the other hand, if your actions have caused pain to others, this card serves as a warning. Her appearance represents an opportunity for you to change your behavior now for a better future. When the Justice card appears in a tarot reading, it's time to account for your actions.

        Another meaning of the Justice card is truth. Truth must prevail, not from gossip but from facts. Understand the truth of others and yourself, speak it out before making judgments, and understand the truth. When you see the Justice tarot card, you need to treat all your actions fairly. By following the correct procedures to understand the truth, you will understand what your task is.

Your future depends on your actions today - and how you'll rebalance the scales. How will you make up for your mistakes? Take action to give yourself the chance to change and stop judging yourself.

        Because this card is about the law of cause and effect, make sure you always treat your partner fairly. Beware of resentment and defensiveness, and make sure to handle conflicts in relationships with respect and trust. Compromise and understanding are needed now.

Meanwhile, his hands are behind his back, forming an inverted triangle. The red pants he wears represent the physical and human passion, while the blue he wears on his shirt represents calm emotions, a common color combination for saints.

The time he spends here will not be wasted, as it is part of his progress. His inverted state can also symbolize the feelings of those who walk a spiritual path, as they view the world differently. If others do not understand the necessity of the sacrifice, you will see it differently. Walking this path alone is a natural course of action for you.

The Hanged Man card reflects the specific need to pause certain actions. Thus, it can indicate a period of indecision. This means that even if there is an urgent need to take action at this particular moment, certain actions or decisions that need to be implemented correctly may be delayed. In fact, if you can delay certain actions to ensure you have more time to think about making key decisions, it will ultimately be for the best.

This is a card primarily about waiting and pausing. It suggests that this might be something you need to do to achieve success or wait for the right opportunity.

Don't try to force or pressure a relationship to blossom; instead, use this time to see how your perspective changes when you are alone. This applies equally to relationships. Timing may be an issue when having important discussions or taking your relationship to the next level.

Sometimes, you just have to wait, and the things you’ve been pushing for, whether it's a response from business partners or colleagues, a decision from clients, or a decision about changing careers, will come in due time.

The Death card signifies that a major phase in your life is coming to an end, and a new one is about to begin. You need to close one door for another to open. The past needs to be placed behind you so you can focus your energy on what is ahead.

Another meaning is that you are about to go through a major change, transition, or transformation. The old version of you needs to 'die' to create the new you. This may be a scary time for you as you may be unsure of what will happen in the future. Even if you are afraid, you should welcome this change because you are opening the door to new life events.

It is important to remember that every door closed by the Death tarot card opens another. While Death in a love tarot reading can be hard to accept, the transformation for one or both partners may be what is needed to help both individuals grow. Equally important is to remember that the card is a suggestion; you can choose to embrace and welcome the transformation in your relationship or let go.

While initially frightening, the transformation that the Death tarot card brings to love can also be positive. In less drastic terms, it can signify the start of a new era, such as an engagement.

On the other hand, old relationships can be revived. If you are single, the reversed Death tarot card in love suggests that you must avoid negative patterns and dynamics to truly engage in a loving relationship.

You may be holding onto your current path because it provides stability, certainty, and security, but if you are unhappy or feel unchallenged in other aspects, you will lose more than just comfort.

We must learn to welcome it rather than push it away. When we hold onto a cycle that is no longer meant to stay in our lives, we watch it decay slowly and drain our energy.

The Temperance card means that you have a clear vision and know what you want to achieve. It is a sign of higher education and a key attribute in your life journey. It reflects that you have found peace in what you are doing, and everything is unfolding as it should. Compared to others, the Temperance card indicates that you can adapt and harmonize with your community, colleagues, and loved ones. Your calmness in all matters brings comfort and reassurance to them.

With the ability to reconcile opposing thoughts and conflicting outcomes, your inner self remains serene and peaceful; you have learned to moderate justice and compassion, success and failure, joy and sorrow, balancing the various demands of life. You accommodate voices that differ from your own but do not fully yield to them; you reconcile conflicting thoughts within yourself, thereby achieving true tolerance.",

A lack of long-term planning or vision can also be the meaning of reversed Temperance. This leaves you without a goal, and you feel unbalanced as you look around for what you should be doing.

When it comes to changing your career path, the Temperance card can remind you to stay patient, steady, and focused; all good things take time.

The man and woman have horns, indicating that the longer they stay with the Devil, the less human they become. The chains make it appear as if they are captured by the Devil.

You may be aware that this way of life is leading you down a rabbit hole, but you feel powerless to control your actions or impulses.

Addiction to material things or sensory pleasures could also be the reason you feel helpless and trapped. In such a case, you may feel like a slave, unable to control your impulses or willpower to guide yourself toward anything beyond these desires.",

If you are just looking for a fling, it's up to you to communicate that to your dates. If they feel your lifestyle isn't suitable for them, ensure you avoid pressuring them. Communication will be more important than ever.

Or, if you purchased a house you couldn't afford and the mortgage payments are strangling you, it might be wiser to sell.

  Doubts and a loss of faith can apply not only to yourself but also to your overall feelings about love.

  Another interpretation of the Moon card is the presence of illusion. Some hidden truths must be discovered because what you see now may be a mere trick of the light. You must seek out the hidden forces that need to be unraveled.",

It can represent confusion and unhappiness—you want to make progress, but you are unsure what the right thing to do is. You must deal with your anxieties and fears by overcoming them because they are like shadows in the dark. It is time to trust yourself and move forward.

  The reversed Moon means you are in a period of intuition, or you have recently been struggling with confusion, anxiety, and self-deception. It may be that you have misinterpreted your feelings, but you are starting to improve in this area.

  Another meaning of the reversed Moon is that the powers of the night that have been bringing you confusion are beginning to dissipate. You have started to manage your fears and anxieties. Any negative energy you have faced is slowly dissipating. Discovering the positive side of things provides a sense of liberation.",

There may be old attitudes, beliefs, or ideas that are clouding your judgment. Many things may be hidden in your subconscious, affecting your ability to accept love.

Now is the time to examine them and reveal their true nature.",

They are about to meet their creator, their deeds measured, and learn where they will spend the remainder of eternity: in heaven or in hell. The massive waves in the background signify that judgement is inevitable and that this judgement will be final.

  Judgement is ruled by Pluto, the ruler of the underworld. It suggests that you make decisions based on your intuition and wisdom, as they will bring significant changes in the coming days.",

  Another reading of the reversed Judgement card can be urging you to take time out from your busy daily life to reflect on your current life and what you have learned so far. You likely have not given yourself enough time or space to thoroughly consider issues and learn the lessons needed to elevate your consciousness. You may also be too critical of your past actions, preventing you from forgiving yourself and moving on. The mistakes we make in the past are learning tools that help us advance in life.

Keep open communication with your partner and ensure that both of you understand each other's needs. The small changes you make together can have a significant impact on your relationship.

Take small steps today and continue to develop your ideas over time. Action is what helps you grow and build momentum. Don’t stay in the abstract.

As you take steps to achieve your goals, you become increasingly aware of the opportunities coming your way, which may take you out of your comfort zone. This sometimes prompts you to embrace change and start thinking long-term.

  The Three of Wands can indicate that you are in control and hold a strong position, just like the figure who overlooks and stands tall. The Three of Wands is one of the main cards of foresight and vision.

  Another meaning of the Three of Wands is travel, seeking what you are looking for. There is a sense of leaving home and embarking on a journey that must be undertaken.

For most readings, this indicates that you may travel across water to new lands, and you may find opportunities during your travels.",

You are merely reacting instead of acting thoughtfully and deliberately.

The five people might signify problems within a group where patience is running thin, and everyone just wants to be heard, without listening to anyone else, causing a lot of arguments all at once.

  Most of the issues could be resolved if the querent takes the first step to try to communicate in a way that suggests everyone should take turns to speak and be heard. By doing this, you will be able to address the problem, and everyone will feel satisfied.

  The Five of Wands can also suggest that you are or will be facing competition in an area you are not used to. This can be at work or school, where you will meet people with the same abilities as you, presenting a significant challenge - leading to feelings of jealousy, greed, and envy.

You might feel overlooked while your rivals, who may not be as loving and caring as you, find success. Often, what is needed is a change in attitude; make sure this does not turn into bitterness. Confidence and positivity are attractive, while negativity often repels others. If you are in a relationship, you or your partner might feel unappreciated or neglected.",

You are likely to have achieved something in your job that you are particularly proud of. Rewards may also be forthcoming; this could mean an upcoming promotion or raise or one that has recently occurred. If you have recently completed a project, it is likely to have a positive outcome. Whatever battles you have fought recently have been resolved in your favor. Enjoy the satisfaction and confidence of this moment. Do not let your confidence venture into arrogance, but do celebrate the end of previous conflicts and enjoy your current position.",
        "reversed_career" => "When reversed, the success usually associated with the Six of Wands is overturned. In this position, the Six of Wands represents failure and a lack of ambition in your work, rather than indicating victory. You may have been overlooked for a promotion or raise. If there has been conflict or competition at work recently, it may not have or will not resolve in your favor. If there is no specific moment of tension, this six may refer to your general feelings about work. These feelings will manifest as a lack of progress or interest in projects. Due to a lack of motivation, you might feel stuck in your current position. Regardless of the exact background, this is a sign of poor performance.",

        "reversed_finances" => "If the Six of Wands appears in this position, take some time to reassess your financial situation. Your finances may be taking a downturn. This might be due to a single negative event or more broadly representing your economic condition. If it is the former, an investment you made might not be yielding results, or a purchase you made is not what you expected. If no individual investment or purchase is causing your financial assets to decrease, your funds might be slowly dwindling. While this might not be a crisis, you could be going through a tough period. It might be hard to muster the confidence to believe things will get better.

Interestingly, in the Rider-Waite depiction of the Seven of Wands, the man wears two different shoes. This relates to the symbolism of being on uneven ground or not having a stable footing in life.",
        "upright_content" => "The meaning of the Seven of Wands is similar to that of the Five of Wands; both cards indicate a struggle after the initial completion and satisfaction of events. However, the Seven of Wands is different because it is about the struggle you need to go through to maintain your position, rather than attaining it. It is about the difficulties you face to continue your success. You should be ready to face the competition to defend your title and prove yourself. This person is the epitome of defense, endurance, and determination. The mismatched shoes refer to unstable foundations in life, with no clear stance. The six wands depict fierceness and challenges.

  The overall meaning of the Seven of Wands is to stand your ground, no matter what challenges you face. You will need to defend this position and oppose those who aim to take your place. There are setbacks during this time, but you need to keep fighting for your beliefs and face those who might threaten or oppose you and your beliefs.",

This can make it difficult to see the whole picture. You may also feel that you have to compete and compare yourself with others, making you feel vulnerable and inadequate.

  The reversed Seven of Wands can also reflect the feeling of being constantly criticized and judged by others. Your friends and family might be questioning your decisions and choices, and you feel overwhelmed by their judgment.

  Avoiding conflict and backing down is common in the reversed Seven of Wands. This leads to unhappiness, as you evade activities and abandon your goals when challenged by anyone. Remember all the struggles you went through to get here, and carefully consider if you truly believe it is worth giving up now. Another interpretation of the reversed Seven of Wands could be that you are being overly aggressive in protecting yourself and, by doing so, damaging your relationships.",

Despite many external factors in your environment working against the two of you, you may need to put in a lot of effort to keep the relationship going. Despite all these factors, you might feel confident that this is the right thing to do. Hold on to that feeling, as it will help keep you energized when things get tough.",

Others may attack you or be envious of your job position. Embrace your inner confidence and move forward fearlessly. Challenges to your position or your ethics may be especially common now. Fortunately, you have the strength to overcome any fears or concerns and successfully stand up for yourself and your beliefs.",
        "reversed_career" => "When the Seven of Wands appears in the tarot, your attempts to stand your ground may not be successful. This could be due to a lack of preparation. You might not be ready to defend your past victories, your principles, or your stance. Now, it is crucial to protect your job position or business, but you are unwilling or unprepared to do so. People often envy success, so merely being content with the status quo is not enough. Sometimes, like now, you may need to be on guard against those who try to undermine you. Any recent choices you made have left you vulnerable to others intruding and stealing the opportunities you are trying to create.",

This financial planning could be in the form of starting a retirement fund, buying a house, or otherwise beginning to save more.

A decision you have been waiting for is likely to come soon. You need to be patient.

  In terms of love, the meaning of the Eight of Wands is about whether you are ready to commit to a relationship; however, the card advises you not to force the other party to be ready for commitment. Your partner will soon be ready, and forcing things to happen may have a negative impact on the outcome. Financially, now does not seem to be the best time for hasty investments. As with your love life, it is advisable to be patient. Save your funds and wait for the best investment opportunity. Everything you have been striving for is continuously evolving.

You must forgive yourself and adjust your strategy.

  In terms of work, there may be disagreements in your office. You need to resolve this issue quickly to avoid any major problems from derailing. Breathe, think, and try to relax.

Either you are not progressing fast enough at work, or you progressed too quickly in the past. Evaluate how you feel. If you feel frustrated by a lack of progress at work, this card may indicate that you missed opportunities by failing to act in time. You are not progressing because you let opportunities slip by. However, if you have recently progressed in your career, you may have moved too fast. This concern manifests as feeling overwhelmed by people's demands on you.

He has identified new worlds to explore, new opportunities he can easily exploit, and he even has the 'big picture' vision necessary for success. Even with all of this, he still tends to either remain dormant or get easily distracted by one idea after another. If he doesn't learn to control this, it could be that he wastes opportunities to elevate himself.

The mountain represents the ambition needed to drive one to seek the pentacle. The flowing stream seems to predict emotions flowing towards this ambition.",
        "upright_content" => "The Aces in the tarot predict new beginnings. When you draw any of them, it means you are at a point where a new cycle is beginning in your life - you are about to start anew.

  Because the suit of Pentacles is primarily concerned with all things material (not just financial, but also sensory), this reset can manifest as a new career, a new venture, or a focus on taking better care of your health. Wherever this beginning occurs, the Ace of Pentacles promises that what is to come will bring great abundance and opportunity.

  Seeing the Ace of Pentacles indicates that a seed is being planted in the material world, in your sense of security and stability. Like a seed, this opportunity must be nurtured, and sometimes it requires investment of energy, time, or funds. Watering this seed can bring very rewarding results - for anything that grows within this energy is meant to be stable, secure, and give good yield. Prosperity is coming your way.

  One must also ensure that they are mentally prepared for the opportunities appearing. To be able to harvest the gifts of the pentacle, we need to be filled with the calm that stability brings, a form of spiritual prosperity, if you will. This mindset may mean being open to trying new things rather than sticking to old, outdated routines.",
        "reversed_content" => "While the Ace of Pentacles usually predicts some kind of opportunity that brings great benefits, seeing it reversed may mean that this could be a bad investment, requiring far more resources than you originally reserved - or you may be missing your chance.

  When one receives the Ace of Pentacles reversed, it can indicate that they will face tough financial times and many elusive opportunities. Currently, it is advised not to take any huge financial risks and to consider all options when a deal is presented.

  This can also be a good time for the individual to seek advice from others and avoid making hasty decisions, as the timing is not right. This is not a good time to jump into a new job or business opportunity, especially if the primary motive for joining is the pursuit of more financial gain. It may just be an illusion that could lead to your downfall.",

Couples may find that their relationship gives them a sense of stability and security, whose influence gives them the confidence to take risks and explore. This gives lovers a sense of independence, allowing each person to thrive as an individual while bringing more to the relationship.

If you’re not in a relationship, be wary of those who appear selfish, greedy, or willing to take advantage of you. This card can also simply indicate missed romantic opportunities.",

You need to take a realistic look at yourself. You may also feel that you have not spent your time wisely and made some poor decisions on your career path.

Successful projects typically require different kinds of expertise, and at this point, the Three of Pentacles means that all the necessary skills have come together. In short, you enjoy working as part of a team and the preliminary success of this larger project.

  The Three of Pentacles shows the successful start of a goal, a sign of encouragement that you should continue working and not give up.

  When you are in such a team, it is best to ensure you try to foster camaraderie as much as possible. Projects with reversed Three of Pentacles are hard to complete in this constant bickering. You may find people not listening to others and everyone working individually. This difference in motivation and ambition will lead to complications.

It is only natural that you want to ensure your stability after working hard to get to where you are. But this also has the potential to turn you into someone who is overly possessive or greedy, wanting to ensure that no one can take away your wealth.

  The Four of Pentacles is also a card that suggests you are in a position of financial stability and investment security. Because of your newfound wealth, you are particularly conservative with your money and absolutely not inclined to gamble when it comes to any financial matters. You protect what you have accumulated and hope to steadily increase your overall net worth.

  Be aware that without risk, there is no reward, and if you spend too much time trying to preserve, you might become a prisoner of your material wealth. Wealth is also a form of energy, and we create what we express.",

You are plagued by certain fears of poverty that force you to become materialistic. You are extremely self-protective and defensive about material things, refusing to open up and trust others out of fear they might take them away.

  On the other hand, you might actually be spending too much money, and you need to start properly managing your actual financial resources.

You might find it hard to collaborate and work in a team, feeling like your ideas are guarded and worrying that others might take credit that belongs to you. These things do happen, address them, but don’t let them consume you.

  One person in the card uses crutches, while the other has a shawl covering her head. She walks barefoot in the snow. In the background, there is a black wall with a stained-glass window depicting five pentacles, suggesting some sort of church.

The symbolism of the Five of Pentacles can also be old debt, high credit card balances, or unpaid loans. It serves as a reminder to consider organizing your finances. Mistakes made in the past might also haunt you.

  Drawing this card might mean that the worst is over, but do not expect change to happen overnight. It will take some time to recover and find your strength again. It signifies that you will be able to regain stability in property, health, relationships, business, or finances.

  Slow recovery from illness can also be indicated by the reversed Five of Pentacles. You will find a treatment that can lead to recovery. If you are caring for someone, it might mean that help will be provided, whether in the form of financial or practical assistance.",

Lovers may find it hard to communicate honestly or emotionally connect, creating a wall between them. Depression may also be an issue.

He holds a balanced scale, representing equality and fairness. It reminds us of the Justice tarot card, which hints at karma and cause and effect, suggesting we receive what we give. His other hand is giving coins to two beggars kneeling at his feet. The Six of Pentacles indicates that you are in a secure enough position to give to others without affecting your own well-being.",
        "upright_content" => "The Six of Pentacles signifies that you are in a good relationship with your income. Like the main character in the card, the money you bring in and your expenses are well balanced, and you are fortunate not to have any stress. You are also grateful for everything you have and are happy to share your wealth with others. From the imagery on the card, the Six of Pentacles can be associated with charity. You could be the person donating money to those in need, or you could be the beggar gratefully receiving what you need from a wealthy benefactor.

  If the card shows you as the giver, you have accumulated wealth, and now you can help others through financial aid. You might have lived in the dark side of the pentacles long enough to see the light. You are considering donating to charity or helping those who need your support and are in the same position you were in before. The Six of Pentacles is not necessarily about material gifts or money; it can also mean your time and presence.

  If the card shows you as one of the beggars, you might be receiving charity from others. This can help you recover, so accept the help – you can repay the kindness in the future. You may also find ways to become self-sufficient in the future. Despite this situation, you should be careful not to become desperate or submissive during this period.",
        "reversed_content" => "The reversed Six of Pentacles can indicate that charity can be one-sided. If you have lent money to someone, you should not expect your money to be repaid, or your kindness to be returned in the future. You should be cautious about whom you lend money to, especially if your finances are unstable. You might also encounter problems with spending and donating more than you can afford.

  The reversed Six of Pentacles can also warn you about debts you owe. It might mean that you have gone overboard, and it will come back as a major issue in the future. During this period, you should also be cautious about business dealings, as you might end up with huge losses instead of returns on investment.

  The reversed Six of Pentacles suggests selfishness related to giving and charity. It could mean that you are willing to give to others in a way that benefits yourself rather than them. Be careful that you are not being charitable just to prove your generosity to others. The source of charity should be selfless, not selfish.",

  If you are considering investing, the Seven of Pentacles indicates that you are ready to put in a lot of effort, time, and work to achieve your desired goals. It reinforces your long-term vision and helps indicate that you are not limited to seeing results in the short term. It shows how much you value your investments due to the effort you are willing to put in.

  The Seven of Pentacles is also related to the fear of failure. You don't know if you will reap the fruits of your labor. When delays occur, it can also indicate frustration. You may have put in a lot of effort into your project, but now it seems that nothing is coming to fruition. The good news is that it means you are learning from your failures and mistakes. It may not seem like it at first, but mistakes allow you to study how to better invest your time to make the most of your future risks.",

Therefore, you need to reassess your choices and figure out where you should place your resources. The reversed meaning of the Seven of Pentacles can also be applied to relationships and the effort and emotions you put into them.

If you are in a relationship, life together might seem tedious or grueling now. Perhaps your relationship might need to create long-term plans or make compromises in daily life or finances to stay together. But this card also reminds us that love isn't always about passionate romance and emotional highs; it's about partners working hard every day to stay together in a constantly changing world.

On the other hand, you might be too distracted to focus on a specific successful strategy. As your efforts are diluted, they might not amount to much. You need to focus on one approach and do research to ensure it is effective.",

It’s possible that you have many things to address. Hard work is essential, but you still need to find a balance.

  In terms of work, job seekers should expect their work to be demanding. The Eight of Pentacles also indicates that you need to have confidence in yourself and your ability to complete the job. For those currently employed, you will be responsible for more tasks and responsibilities. Do not hesitate to ask your colleagues for help. In terms of love, your work may impact your relationships. No matter how demanding your job is, you need to make time to establish emotional connections with others.

  In financial matters, the Eight of Pentacles can indicate that the financial assistance you have been hoping for is coming.

The Nine of Pentacles not only conveys happiness but also a sense of security and freedom that material wealth can bring.

The appearance of the Six of Cups in a tarot reading seems to suggest that while we can look at the past with fondness, we must avoid living in it.

  The Six of Cups may also mean that you will be returning to a familiar place. This could be your hometown, an old friend's house, a school, or any place that holds significant meaning for you. You are seeking to reconnect with people from your past. Bringing back old memories reminds us of our childhood, a time when things were simpler.

  Following the Five of Cups, this card can also suggest that you may have experienced some loss or disappointment, and you are finding your way back home.

  Another interpretation of the reversed Six of Cups is that you might feel disconnected from your childhood self and the dreams of that child, which sometimes may be unrealistic. Not reaching these goals can be painful, but sometimes reality opens a path you must follow, and you should not blame yourself for your choices.

If you and your partner have had a stressful period in your relationship, looking back at the good times you've spent together and perhaps reliving them can bring you great comfort.

At some point in life, you will need to stop fantasizing and face the reality of life.

  If you are unable to make a decision due to having too many options, you should evaluate the pros and cons of each choice to make the best one. Be cautious when making decisions, as the card itself seems to suggest that you have access to wonders and treasures, but also monsters and shadows.

  In some cases, the Seven of Cups may indicate that your lifestyle is not necessarily based on real life - your actions are being guided by illusions you feed yourself. Your ideas might be so clouded, developed solely by your imagination. Therefore, you need to distinguish what is real and what is not, so you can make better choices.

Here, you have found them, and you are indulging yourself as you celebrate this new phase of your life.

  When we look at the Nine of Cups, it initially appears to be one of the most pleasant cards to appear in a reading. It is also known as the wish card, meaning that the things you desire, or your most perfect dreams, will undoubtedly happen. The Nine of Cups is usually associated with extreme happiness and satisfaction.

  Regarding your work, there is a good change, and something wonderful will happen at your workplace. It is time to push forward your stalled projects, or if you have something you desire greatly, you are likely to achieve it finally. In love, it also has positive significance. Your romantic relationship with someone is destined to reach a new level. If you are still single, it is time to engage with new friends.

  In terms of finances, the Nine of Cups is also a positive messenger. It may mean that the financial state you have been hoping for will soon come true. In terms of your health, the tests you need to take will lead to positive results. The good energy you are receiving now should be used to improve your health habits.",

  Your path has been a difficult one, and you have reached a period that seems fulfilling, but something else is still missing. This can manifest as smugness on the surface, and it can indicate that you want recognition and acknowledgment for your achievements. But you still feel personally dissatisfied with yourself—as if your desires are never-ending, a black hole. Where does this come from? What aspects of yourself are you lacking confidence in?

On the other hand, you might be so engrossed in a relationship that you have not noticed the personal growth you need.

You might find the job harder, more boring, or just too difficult to handle. There might also be a lack of reward, and your efforts might go unrecognized.

It symbolizes perseverance as this is the only way to achieve your dreams. Listen to your intuition, follow your calling, and believe that everything is possible.

  For those afraid to express their emotions, the Page of Cups may signify that it is time to release and show these emotions.

This cup is closed, which is why the Queen of Cups symbolizes our subconscious thoughts. The queen sits alone, allowing her to reflect.

The card itself shows a king seated on a throne, with an amulet shaped like a fish. The fish on his necklace represents his creativity and spirit thriving in the calm waters around him. We can see from the background that there is a stable balance between the conscious and the unconscious.

  Behind the king, to the right, a fish jumps out of the sea, and to the left, there is a ship, representing the emotional and material worlds respectively. The King of Cups indicates that you do not suppress your impulses but have learned to manage them in a balanced way.",

This card shows the ability to restrain one's emotions and fully control one's feelings and impulses. Therefore, the King of Cups represents a balance between reason and emotion. He points to a strong relationship between understanding and feeling.

  When you have balanced your emotions and can control them, it means you have a deeper understanding and awareness of yourself. When you face challenges that would normally throw you off balance, the King of Cups reminds you to act as he does - don't fly off the handle or immediately throw yourself into despair! You first need to reconcile your emotional state so you can move forward in reality. Learn to assess yourself to determine how to gain a stronger awareness of your inner state.

  In some cases, the King of Cups can symbolize an older male figure in your life. This is a mature man willing to take responsibility for his actions and has mastered self-awareness.

  The King of Cups tends to be political and diplomatic, allowing him to balance the needs of others and enhance harmony between parties.

His talent for navigating others' emotions might be used for questionable purposes, manipulating the environment to meet his needs.

  The reversed King of Cups indicates a character in your life, whether a part of yourself or someone else. While he is usually accessible and in control of his emotions, he has recently become manipulative and controlling. His actions will be used for revenge and retaliation, usually controlling impulses that he normally restrains, ultimately aiming to serve as a form of punishment.",

  When we take a closer look at the sword and see its double edges, we are also reminded that this sword can be used for noble deeds or for destruction.

Regarding your work, you may currently be in a deadlock, possibly waiting for a decision from another party. Be patient and avoid forcing people into making hasty decisions.

You can continue to fight, but sometimes that is ineffective, and you must recognize your strength to decide when to withdraw. Resting and retreating are acts of self-love, and while you may try to push forward, it will only become harder in the long run.",

You might be trying too hard to impress someone or going on dates every day to find the right person. You may feel worn out, and it is important to listen to your intuition and body, giving it time to rest. If you are in a relationship, both of you can benefit from taking a break. Sometimes, this card can also predict that you two need some time alone; this does not mean the end of the relationship, but everyone, especially introverts, needs some private time.",
        "reversed_love" => "If you haven't heeded the warning to rest, the reversed Four of Swords tarot love meaning can suggest you will have no choice. If you have been relentlessly pursuing a potential lover, you may find your advances now unwelcome. You might benefit from giving this person time and space to make their own choices. Pressuring someone usually has the opposite effect of what you want. Alternatively, this card can also indicate coming out of a period of rest. You may feel more energized than ever! Couples who feel their relationship has become a bit too routine may find their passion reignited.",

Listen to your body and allow yourself to take a break. If possible, take a mental health day and use it to take care of yourself or catch up on sleep. We are not machines, and without some much-needed rest, the effects on our health can be lasting. Afterward, you can return feeling refreshed.",
        "reversed_career" => "You may have given yourself a much-needed break from work, but you might now be ready to return. Ideally, you used this time to relieve stress and do some much-needed self-care. With time passing and feeling refreshed, you may find situations that once made you feel stressed and frustrated are easier to handle. From now on, try to be more aware of your stress levels. However, sometimes, despite needing rest, this card can indicate continuing to work. If this is your situation, you might need to reconsider. Our bodies often force us to take breaks. If things do not seem to be improving, you might also need to consider changing jobs.",
        "upright_finances" => "Are you worrying about what’s in your bank? If you are accustomed to dealing with financial stress, it may be second nature for you to think (or rather worry) about your finances. Try to give your mind a break. Often, letting a thought run in circles does not solve anything, and the best thing we can do for our minds is to think about something else. Avoid letting obsessive and negative thoughts consume you.",
        "reversed_finances" => "Your financial situation may be improving, and you might be recovering from a period of great stress. Perhaps bills are being paid, debts are being settled, or expenses are decreasing. Alternatively, stress may be increasing, and you may start feeling overwhelmed by bills. Seek support; someone may be able to help you at this time. Sometimes, this card can also suggest that despite having it, you may not be accepting financial support.",
        "yes_no" => "The Four of Swords points to some sort of illness or retreat. However, it also brings rest, healing, and order. Other interpretations might simply be a need to take a break or call a truce. This card is quite mild in position but overall positive. The answer is most likely yes.",
        "past" => "The plans you have already made may not guide you correctly through the coming changes. The shadow you feel looming over you will soon pass, and the warmth of your life will return.",

He possesses five swords—taken from the other fighters on the card. Two other figures walk away slowly, with a sense of loss and sadness. Above them, the sky is cloudy, indicating that while the battle is over, all is not well.",
        "upright_content" => "This card indicates that you are embroiled in some form of conflict. It may also suggest disagreements with others, leading to hostility and tension. Although you think you have won, in the grand scheme, you may still lose because you have alienated or hurt those you argued with, leading you down a path of isolation. At this moment, you might believe being right is more important than understanding the other person's perspective.

It is crucial to try and pick up the pieces now. You still have the opportunity to act before the conflict escalates. You may feel like everyone and everything is against you. You might also lose some friends in the process. This is why you need to make significant decisions about your stance. What is more important to you? Mutual progress or mutual destruction? This may require you to bravely face your inner conflicts.

This card represents ambition in a rather negative way. Too much ambition without considering consequences or the people you affect is never good. The misplaced ambition depicted by this card can make you a frustrated loser or a callous winner—both quite negative. This card instead asks us to be more considerate of those around us and to let go of our ego.",

The reversed meaning of the Five of Swords tells you that all you want is for this particular period to be over so you can forget and forgive. Because you are starting to realize that winning isn’t everything, you will be able to focus your energy on more constructive and positive activities.

Alternatively, another interpretation of this card in reverse is that the conflict you are experiencing will become even more unsettling when you realize that there are no winners. These are the terms you need to come to grips with.",

There may be a sense of anxiety and harshness in the air, making arguments and fights easy to start. You and your partner may be feeling irritable, and conflicts can start easily if you’re not careful. If you find yourself in one of these, you should carefully consider your reasons in the fight and ensure that you’re not arguing just to be right. Ego can push you and your loved one into conflict without any real reason. Sometimes, this can create passion when needed, but if it continues, it can be destructive.",
        "reversed_love" => "With the reversed Five of Swords tarot love meaning, reconciliation after intense tensions is possible. There is a desire between you and your lover to put down your swords and seek compromise. Even if both parties choose to let go, the wounds are likely still painful. Sometimes, if reconciliation is not possible, this card can indicate walking away from a lover or potential relationship. While it is painful, it may be the better option if intense arguments happen frequently. Sometimes, in the long run, it is better to cut losses and leave before more damage is done.",
        "upright_career" => "Conflict at work is erupting, and there is a considerable amount of hostility in the air. Arguments can be easily provoked now. This can come from misunderstandings, lack of communication, or poor leadership. The Five of Swords can also indicate bullying and intimidation. Whether it is you or someone else, you may be required to stand up for yourself or others. While it is tempting, make sure you handle this professionally and don’t be afraid to pull in HR if needed. Often, processes are in place to handle these situations. However, this card can also point to self-sabotage, meaning your perception of the situation may first be causing these conflicts. Defensive behavior often creates a cycle of attacks.",

Compromises can be made, and open communication is possible again. If this does not apply to you, this card can also suggest that hostility is escalating. If you have been dealing with workplace bullies, they may retaliate, sometimes even trying to get you fired. Don’t be afraid to bring this up with your manager or HR; it is their job to handle these conflicts. However, once you do, make sure your behavior does not draw attention either.

Sometimes this card can also indicate financial strain; you may need to cut some luxury expenses from your budget.",

From the image, we can see that the woman and child are facing away from us, leaving something behind. The woman is cloaked, which might suggest she is in hiding, leaving in a situation where her true identity must remain unknown. We can assume that, because of this, she is experiencing a great loss or sadness. The symbolism in the Six of Swords is about loss or change, and moving toward a future that looks more promising than the one left behind. The six swords placed beside the boat symbolize the power of a rational mind compared to intuition and the heart.",
        "upright_content" => "The meaning of the Six of Swords is that you are going through a transition that is not entirely happy but necessary. This transition is likely the result of decisions you made in the past, now forcing you to leave something behind to move forward. While you may feel sad, you need to remember that moving on is the best choice for your future.

Life is filled with moments where you will have to let go of things you have grown attached to. This will be challenging. The Six of Swords shows the sadness you may be feeling, but you must remember that pain does not last forever, so you should look to the future for strength.

In life, sometimes the only way to solve a problem is to leave it behind and start anew. You might feel that this is the coward's way out, but when you have tried all other methods, running away is the only option. The important part is to plan your new path, guiding you toward happiness. In this case, the Six of Swords is using your logic, clarity, and objectivity to plan where you are now, where you have been, and where you want to go. Intuition can help, but you need logical thinking to ensure success.",
        "reversed_content" => "The reversed Six of Swords can indicate that you have been trying to move on and make necessary transitions. However, you might be encountering challenges that make these a reality. You may keep going back to the past, either due to unresolved issues or because you are second-guessing your decisions.

Another reversed Six of Swords meaning is that you have been resisting the transitions that life is giving you. You may feel like you are being forced to move before you are ready, or you do not want to move at all. In this case, you should consider the benefits of these movements rather than the drawbacks. Like Orpheus in the underworld, you must look forward and not back, for looking back may risk collapse.",

Sometimes, this can take the form of ending a relationship or moving past a painful chapter in your relationship and finding reconciliation. Either way, it suggests leaving the past behind and moving towards an unknown but brighter future. If you are single, you may be ready to leave a part of yourself behind, perhaps the part that hindered you from accepting love. If you have old wounds you have been nursing, the Six of Swords tarot love meaning can be a welcome sight. You may finally be ready to leave them behind.",

The reversed Six of Swords tarot love meaning indicates that despite your attempts to leave it behind, the past still has a firm hold on you. On one hand, you may know that leaving the past is the healthiest thing for you, but you may be compulsively drawn back. You may choose to stay in a relationship devoid of love, remembering its happy moments, unable to let go of a toxic ex, or past insecurities may prevent you from fully enjoying your love life.

Sometimes, this card can also suggest that you may be the one causing trouble; instead of letting things go, you may be returning to the same issues repeatedly, holding grudges while the other party is willing to move on. You may want to examine your own attitude and defensiveness to see if it contributes to your stress levels. What can you let go of? If you do manage to leave this job, be mindful of the same issues reappearing. We can escape environments, people; but not ourselves.",

The man's expression shows a hint of confidence, as if he is sure that his mission to steal the swords will be successful. Unfortunately for him, there seems to be a group of soldiers on the left who have noticed the theft, with one soldier raising a flag or weapon as if to signal pursuit.",
        "upright_content" => "Generally, the Seven of Swords is about betrayal and deception. When you draw this card, it can mean that you or someone in your life is trying to get away with something. Sometimes, we are forced to be sneaky, hoping we won’t get caught. When we are discovered, we must face the consequences—whether it’s embarrassment, punishment, or worse. This occurs when you need to stand up and do something clever and out of character. Now, there is a danger that secrets might be exposed.

You might want to sneak away from somewhere, indicating that the situation is no longer working as expected. Instead of dealing with it, you choose to sneak away and hope that it goes unnoticed. Perhaps you hope the issue will resolve itself over time, but ignoring it only makes it worse.

The biggest question when looking at the Seven of Swords is whether evasion will solve the problem you are facing. While you may think you’ve escaped, you may find the situation has backed you into a corner, and you are discovered while trying to flee.

In some cases, the Seven of Swords can indicate a desire to go it alone. You might want to explore and discover some things on your own. If you wish to maintain your independence and circumvent collective agreements, this can be an effective approach. The symbolism of the Seven of Swords might encourage you to go down this path; sometimes, innovation comes from rogue geniuses.",
        "reversed_content" => "Depending on the messages from the other cards in the tarot spread, the reversed Seven of Swords can have multiple meanings. It can first indicate the need to change your approach; the strategies you’ve been using aren’t working. While upright, this card can represent cunning victories gained through deceit and trickery, its reversal can represent the more extreme versions of such behavior. Alternatively, it can signify a renewal of conscience. You or someone in your circle may decide to lift the burden of guilt and confess to some manipulation they were involved in. Trust has been broken, but through confession, you may be repairing it. There is a desire here to try things differently, to collaborate rather than act independently.",

If your intuition is telling you that you’re being deceived, you may need to face this and have an honest discussion. If this is you, consider the long-term consequences of your actions. Even the most well-intentioned lies can lead to significant problems if the root cause is not addressed. If you’re single, you may need to evaluate whether you’re being too suspicious or untrusting of potential lovers, or on the other hand, whether you’re misleading them or exaggerating about yourself.",
        "reversed_love" => "The reversed Seven of Swords tarot love meaning can indicate the end of lies and deceit. Dishonesty always eventually comes to light, and this card suggests that the truth is surfacing. If you have been deceitful, it is more important in the long run to admit and own up to any wrongdoing. Carrying the burden of dishonesty is not easy; it usually comes with the constant anxiety of being discovered. Those seeking love may be more willing to let go of any vanity or stop playing games. In the long run, this can bring you more fulfillment than constantly altering yourself for love.",

In such cases, be cautious of whom you trust; it might come from the least expected sources. Sometimes, this card can also indicate that you need a degree of strategy to complete your projects. You might be the underdog here, while others have more resources or established positions. Tactical work can now be an advantage for you.",

As long as you make amends and face the consequences, forgiveness is possible. Alternatively, situations at work may escalate; sometimes, those at fault are not publicly held accountable. Remember, no matter how disappointing, one’s character will determine their future fate.

By handing over your power to an unknown entity, whether it is fate, God, the government, or something else, you are relinquishing your personal responsibility to influence change. In the journey of your life, you have willingly given up the driver’s seat, and this has not been working out well for you. It is advisable to avoid making any major decisions at this time because your judgment is likely clouded.

The good news is that since these traps are of our own making, we can also leave them if we put our minds to it. It’s just a matter of removing the blindfold, getting beyond the limited perspective we have created for ourselves, seeing the possibilities, and realizing you have your inner power.",

We deny ourselves possibilities when we are too afraid to do the hard work of communicating our boundaries or standing up for ourselves. To make a change, you must be the one to take action and take control. Freedom does not come with passivity. If you are single, this card can also indicate that you are too passive in your love life.

The blanket is decorated with various astrological symbols and roses.

Sometimes this card can be linked to trauma, something that you might feel ashamed to talk about with others, and all the psychological responses that come from experiencing that trauma.

When we can never get out of the entrapment depicted in the Eight of Swords, we escalate to the Nine of Swords, where we are tormented by nightmares. A suit of swords, which deals with the mind, logic, intelligence, and communication, somehow gets stuck on the destructive end of the mind, turning inward on itself, breeding and festering. The problems plague you, and you find yourself reciting all the possibilities and all the things that could happen to you. You are haunted by what might be.

There is a sense of repetition in this card, events that previously troubled you, events you managed to suppress or run away from, coming back again. Sharing your grief can at least provide an outlet for your pain and can help you unburden yourself from carrying this alone. Is there someone who can make you feel comfortable?

If this is more about general anxiety rather than trauma, analyze yourself and think about whether this feeling is within your control or if there are other factors contributing to your anxiety. Focus on things you can control and learn to seek help.",

You have to work a lot to drag yourself toward release. But just as you have a way out, you must also realize that you might fall deeper into despair.

Anxiety can lead you to avoid looking at issues and facing them, but if you work to open your eyes, you may find that you can resolve these problems.

There is a terrifying silence in the air: the sky above him is dark and ominous, indicating fear and negativity associated with death. The water in front of him is still, with no ripples, adding to the eerie silence and finality of the card. Looking to the horizon, the sun is rising in the east despite the darkness, and the weather appears calm. The Ten of Swords seems to suggest that this is the lowest point in life, with nothing worse to come. At least, even in this state, the sun is rising.",

There is a sense of betrayal here, as the character has been stabbed in the back. It seems to remind us that despite our many efforts, we cannot control everything, and some things are beyond our ability to change. Here, the situation is inevitable.

The story of the Suit of Swords is a powerful metaphor that ends in tragedy. Swords represent intellect, wisdom, and logic, yet we find that the final climax of this suit is the utter and complete failure of the mind. We must recognize that swords are weapons with the potential for great destruction or benefit. The story unfolding from the Ace to the Ten is one of an untrained person using this weapon for the wrong reasons—making many mistakes and then spending a lifetime trying to escape the power they misused.

This person believed the swords were part of him, external, and when they inevitably returned, he suffered once again. His pain is not the usual pain but the pain of fear, anxiety, and the inability to control his environment. After the despair of the Nine of Swords, what can possibly happen next? Are you suffocated by stress? Or did you pick up the last sword and surrender yourself?

The Ten of Swords describes a \"woe is me\" mentality, where you feel helpless. Pause and remember, just like the Death card, the end of something means new beginnings. Let go of what you have lost and focus on the new path ahead, as that is your life's goal. A good example is breaking up with your partner; while it can be very painful, it can also be the start of a new sense of independence.",

But like the Eight and Nine of Swords, this release must be initiated by yourself. Here lies an opportunity to correct what has harmed you, but you must work to climb out. What happened was terrible, but everyone has a responsibility.",

While this period may be extremely difficult, you need to accept it and come to terms with the inevitable end. For singles, you may be dealing with similar lingering feelings from past relationships.

Alternatively, you may find yourself needing to use her energy to stay alert, keep your eyes open, and remain sharp and vigilant.

She indeed has compassion, which is why her hand is extended in offering, but she wants to connect with people through a rational understanding.

This card also implies that you need to be independent in your judgment. You must rely on impartial intelligence, which allows you to consider other viewpoints and weigh your decisions carefully. In these situations, compassion and empathy can distract you from the task, so you need to work to maintain a strong objective perspective while avoiding getting entangled in emotions.

It can also relate to how we communicate with others. This queen has the ability to tell people exactly how it is. This enables her to express her views clearly and avoids any confusion about what she says. Above all, truth is important to her, so she feels no need to soften her comments, thoughts, or opinions.
